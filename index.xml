Through your arms and out your fingers, down kilometers of cables and switches and cables again out into the cities and the seas? Or not quite the world - even today when the Internet sees and it hears and it claims it stops still short that final hop into &lt;em>the world proper&lt;/em>. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s just my old-fashioned brain using old-fashioned thoughts to draw a ring fence around what I still think of as offline. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how you&amp;rsquo;d tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble with this website is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t what I want either. I think probably all I want is to reclaim my twitter from its orbit around my profession, where it sits frozen and inert, too afraid to speak how or of what I &lt;em>truly&lt;/em> wish lest it spark somewhere a regrettable second thought, or (worse still) lay the first virtual breadcrumb on the trail that leads too swiftly to my real front door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this website sits perched sadly atop its own peculiar tower, imprisoned amidst the treetops. A squirrel might look in, but what if it did? And the cold anonymity of the stonework is an almost literal façade - it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take a terribly curious cat to trace it back to its maker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the italics look horrible - what is this font?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to write. And I think it feels nice to unfurl what&amp;rsquo;s written out of the window, thin as it is. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s not likely spotted - &lt;em>there&lt;/em> is better than not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— O&lt;/p>

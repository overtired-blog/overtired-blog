<span class=post-author>Sleepy</span></div><div class=post-content><div><p>Do you ever feel like you can <em>feel</em> the Internet? Through your arms and out your fingers, down kilometers of cables and switches and cables again out into the cities and the seas? Or not quite the world - even today when the Internet sees and it hears and it claims it stops still short that final hop into <em>the world proper</em>. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s just my old-fashioned brain using old-fashioned thoughts to draw a ring fence around what I still think of as offline. But I&rsquo;m not sure how you&rsquo;d tell.</p><p>The trouble with this website is that it isn&rsquo;t what I want either. I think probably all I want is to reclaim my twitter from its orbit around my profession, where it sits frozen and inert, too afraid to speak how or of what I <em>truly</em> wish lest it spark somewhere a regrettable second thought, or (worse still) lay the first virtual breadcrumb on the trail that leads too swiftly to my real front door.</p><p>But this website sits perched sadly atop its own peculiar tower, imprisoned amidst the treetops. A squirrel might look in, but what if it did? And the cold anonymity of the stonework is an almost literal façade - it wouldn&rsquo;t take a terribly curious cat to trace it back to its maker.</p><p>Also the italics look horrible - what is this font?</p><p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s nice to write. And I think it feels nice to unfurl what&rsquo;s written out of the window, thin as it is. Even if it&rsquo;s not likely spotted - <em>there</em> is better than not.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=/posts/second/><span class=button__text>Second</span>

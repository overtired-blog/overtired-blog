Through your arms and out your fingers, down kilometers of cables and switches and cables again out into the cities and the seas? Or not quite the world - even today when the Internet sees and it hears and it claims it stops still short that final hop into the world proper.

Through your arms and out your fingers, down kilometers of cables and switches and cables again out into the cities and the seas? Or not quite the world - even today when the Internet sees and it hears and it claims it stops still short that final hop into &lt;em>the world proper&lt;/em>. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s just my old-fashioned brain using old-fashioned thoughts to draw a ring fence around what I still think of as offline. But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how you&amp;rsquo;d tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble with this website is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t what I want either. I think probably all I want is to reclaim my twitter from its orbit around my profession, where it sits frozen and inert, too afraid to speak how or of what I &lt;em>truly&lt;/em> wish lest it spark somewhere a regrettable second thought, or (worse still) lay the first virtual breadcrumb on the trail that leads too swiftly to my real front door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this website sits perched sadly atop its own peculiar tower, imprisoned amidst the treetops. A squirrel might look in, but what if it did? And the cold anonymity of the stonework is an almost literal faÃ§ade - it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take a terribly curious cat to trace it back to its maker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the italics look horrible - what is this font?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to write. And I think it feels nice to unfurl what&amp;rsquo;s written out of the window, thin as it is. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s not likely spotted - &lt;em>there&lt;/em> is better than not.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Second</title><link>/posts/second/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 01:06:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/second/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a second post.
